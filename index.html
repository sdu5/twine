   This is a game about school bullying. The player takes part in events and makes choices in the third person. (Note that your choice will guide the direction of the event, and your choice is also risky). In the game you face two forces, one is the force of the bullies, the other is the force of the classmates. Your choice will affect your reputation with both. The value of Reputation will determine where you end up.
